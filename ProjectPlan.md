# Project Plan - GroceryListManager 

This document describes the overall process and the high level plan for constructing a Grocery List Management **(GroceryListManager)** Application.

**Author**: 6300Fall16Team95  
**Version**: 1.0.0  

## 1 Introduction

**GroceryListManager**  is a software product for mobile phones that handles a typical set of grocery shopping lists maintained by a household user.

## 2 Process Description

The process to be followed to build this system is Rational Unified Process(RUP), and the subsequent section describes the phases and activities involved in this process.

### Activity 1: Inception 
**Description:** During this phase, the business problem is defined and there are several other activities performed to initiate the project. Main activities involved in this phase are requirements gathering, business modeling and generating initial use cases for the business problem. These activities will help to identify the scope of the project.  
**Entrance criteria:** Business Idea or the problem definition.  
**Exit criteria:** Detailed requirements specification the describes requirements, initial usecase model, project glossary and business case.

### Activity 2: Elaboration 
**Description:** The main goal of this phase is to come up with a detailed system design. Main activities involved in this phase include:  
* Analyzing the problem domain to determine the feasibility of the project
* Defining high-level architecture of the system
* Identifying high-risk or critical use cases
* Creating User Interface prototypes
* Identifying non-functional requirements of the system 
* Refining the project plan
* Creation of testing plan  

**Entrance criteria:** Requirements specification, initial usecase model, project glossary and business case  
**Exit criteria:** Detailed system design which includes class diagram, sequence diagram, completed usecase model, component diagram, deployment and entity-relationship diagrams defining the data model, system architecture, supplementary requirements document, user interface prototypes and test cases.

### Activity 3: Construction
**Description:** Implementing the designed system and testing are the main activities performed in this phase. The system should address all the functional requirements and should be thoroughly tested.  
**Entrance criteria:** System Design Document.  
**Exit criteria:** First external release of the software (beta version), completed user manual, test results.  

### Activity 4: Transition
**Description:** During this phase the system is deployed for end users. The main activities performed are train end users, validate system against end user expectations and perform maintenance tasks for the issues reported by end users.  
**Entrance criteria:** Production release of the software system.  
**Exit criteria:** Completed, working system.  

## 3 Team
**Team members:** Adelene Sim, Atharva Patel, Lalanthi Perera

**Roles**:  
1. *System Analyst:* Coordinates requirements gathering and model use-cases.  
2. *Software Architect:* Leads and coordinates technical activities and artifacts throughout the project. The software architect establishes the overall software architecture for the project.  
3. *Project Manager:* Allocates resources, shapes priorities, coordinates interactions with customers and users, and establishes a set of practices that ensure the integrity and quality of project artifacts, delivers results to the clients.  
4. *Test Analyst:* Responsible for initially identifying and subsequently defining the required tests, monitoring the test coverage and evaluating the overall quality experienced when testing the test items.  
5. *Developer:* Responsible for developing and testing components, in accordance with the projectâ€™s adopted standards.  
6. *Integrator:* Integrators combine each developers components to produce a build. Also maintains builds for different environments such as system, staging and production.  
7. *Quality Assurance Analyst:* Makes sure that all the artifacts of the project including software functionality, code and supporting documents are meeting the quality expectations of the clients.
